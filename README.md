For this project, I created a simple CRUD application using React and JSONPlaceholder API. The application allows users to retrieve and display a list of posts, create a new post, delete a post, and update a post.

To make HTTP requests to the JSONPlaceholder API, I used Axios. I also used React Hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage state and lifecycle methods, respectively.

For the design, I used Material UI to create a clean and responsive interface. I also used LottieFiles to add some animations and visual interest to the application.

To give users feedback on their actions, I used React-Toastify to display success and error messages when a post is created, updated, or deleted.

Finally, to persist data even after the user closes the application, I used localStorage as a simple database solution.

In addition, I used TypeScript to add type-checking to the application, which helped catch errors during development and made the code easier to maintain.
